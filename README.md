# NFTPriceTrackerAndForecaster
We will create an NFT price tracker to compare and forecast NFT valuations to  provide recommendations for NFT investors, collectors and traders.  It will aggregate top NFT projects based on popularity and activity, and help new NFT investors decide which NFTs to purchase based on their risk tolerance  We will consider the data like the prices, volume , life span of project, ranking/popularity , trends/activity by using APIs like OpenSea (as available)


***This notebook needs pyvizenv env to display all the images in panel and alpacha env to load env variables**

This can be done by activating the pyvizenv env and also loading the alpaca apis using below commands

pip install python-dotenv
pip install alpaca-trade-api (this one might not be needed as we are getting data from opensea API)
