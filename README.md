# NFTPriceTrackerAndForecaster
We will create an NFT price tracker to compare and forecast NFT valuations to  provide recommendations for NFT investors, collectors and traders.  It will aggregate top NFT projects based on popularity and activity, and help new NFT investors decide which NFTs to purchase based on their risk tolerance  We will consider the data like the prices, volume , life span of project, ranking/popularity , trends/activity by using APIs like OpenSea (as available)
